## Cyclistic Data Set

This Data set required to understand how to convert CASUAL riders to MEMBER riders.

## Preliminary Observations

- Location Data was Incomplete
- Negative or "0" duration trips were excluded

## Trip Duration Calculations
### Minutes/Trip

```{r Average Bike Trips, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(bike_trips_2$trip_duration_minutes)
```

## Types of Riders

```{r Types of Riders, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(bike_trips_2, aes(x=member_casual)) + geom_bar()+
  labs(title="What types of riders ride the bikes",x="Rider type",y="# of riders")
```

## Types of riders by  bike (group)

```{r}
ggplot(bike_trips_2, aes(x=member_casual, fill = rideable_type)) + geom_bar()+
  labs(title="What type of riders ride the bikes by bike type",x="Rider type",y="# of riders")
```

## Most popular bikes by member (group)

```{r}
ggplot(bike_trips_2, aes(x=rideable_type, fill = member_casual)) + geom_bar()+
  labs(title="What type of bike do member/casual riders use?",x="Bike type",y="# of riders")
```

## Rides per day of week by member (group)

```{r}
ggplot(bike_trips_2, aes(x=weekday, fill = member_casual)) + geom_bar()+
  labs(title="What is the most popular day for a bike ride?",x="weekday",y="# of riders")
```

## Rides per month (group)

```{r}
ggplot(bike_trips_2, aes(x=month, fill = member_casual)) + geom_bar()+
  labs(title="What is the most popular month for bike rides?",x="month",y="# of riders")
```


## Types of riders with bike type
```{r}
ggplot(data_for_member, aes(x=member_casual, fill = rideable_type)) + geom_bar()+
  labs(title="What type of bikes member riders use?",x="Rider type",y="# of riders")
```

## Most popular bikes (member)
```{r}
ggplot(data_for_member, aes(x=rideable_type, fill=month)) + geom_bar()+
  labs(title="What type of bike do member riders use?",x="Bike type",y="# of riders")
```

## Rides per day of week (member)
```{r}
ggplot(bike_trips_2, aes(x=weekday, fill = month)) + geom_bar()+
  labs(title="Rides per Day of the Week",x="Rider type",y="# of riders")
```

## Rides per month (member)
```{r}

## Types of riders 
```{r}

  labs(title="What type of bikes do casual riders use?",x="Rider type",y="# of riders")
```

## Most popular bikes (casual)
```{r}
ggplot(data_for_member, aes(x=rideable_type, fill=month)) + geom_bar()+
  labs(title="What type of bike do casual riders use by month?",x="Bike type",y="# of riders")
```

## Rides per day of week (casual)
```{r}
ggplot(data_for_member, aes(x=weekday, fill = month)) + geom_bar()+
  labs(title="most popular days for casual bike rides",x="weekday",y="# of riders")
```

## Rides per month (casual)
```{r}
ggplot(data_for_member, aes(x=month, fill = weekday)) + geom_bar()+
  labs(title="What is the most popular month for casual bike rides?",x="month",y="# of riders")
```

## Riders/hour (casual)
```{r}
ggplot(data_for_casual, aes(x=start_hour, fill=weekday)) + geom_bar(stat="count")+
  labs(title="riders/hour for casual riders", x="starting hour", y="# of riders")
```

## Riders/hour (members)
```{r}
ggplot(data_for_member, aes(x=start_hour, fill=weekday)) + geom_bar(stat="count")+
  labs(title="riders/hour for member riders", x="starting hour", y="# of riders")
```

## Riders/hour by type
```{r}
ggplot(bike_trips_2, aes(x=start_hour, fill=member_casual)) + geom_bar(stat="count")+
  labs(title="Riders per hour by type", x="starting hour", y="# of riders")
```

## Average Trip Duration
```{r Average Trip Duration, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bike_trips_2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(trip_duration_minutes)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

## Deductions

- Casual Riders ride mostly on Weekends
- Member Riders ride a stable amount everyday except Sunday
- May-October are high-volume months/November-March are low-volume months
- Peak times for usage are between 4pm and 6pm
- Most days in a row with bike rented = 27 days


## Recommendations
- Create memberships for 6 months, possibly 3 months
- Create memberships for weekends only
- Set up pricing so that the incentive is to buy more and save more
- Create events in March and December for Members so that there is more reason
to buy a full year's membership instead of 6 months/3 months/by the minute
