# Excel Projects Summary 

## Games Dashboard
#### This was a dashboard I built from a random data set from the internet. The task was to be able to take a simple set of data and be able to categorize and visualize the data using slicers. The data itself was not much to work with and seemed incomplete, but I was able to make a simple dashboard for the different categories that were given.

## Logistics Dashboard
#### This was a dashboard I built from a set of logistical data. The data was fairly robust so a lot of different connections could be made within the data, including financial and route analysis. The task was to develop a dashboard with 2 pages (dashboard, schedule) that could summarize the data for the two drivers given. 

## Ecvols
#### This interactive dashboard was created for a Russian water filtration company. The data (included in the file) showed the company's finances over the past 6 years. The task was to create a dashboard to show their financial results.
